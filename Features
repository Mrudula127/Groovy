1)Groovy features not available in Java include both static and dynamic typing (with the keyword def), operator overloading, 
native syntax for lists and associative arrays (maps), native support for regular expressions, polymorphic iteration, 
expressions embedded inside strings, added helper methods, and the safe navigation operator ?. 
to check automatically for null pointers (for example, variable?.method(), or variable?.field)

Document Object Model (DOM) syntax. This feature enables the definition and manipulation of many types of heterogeneous
data assets with a uniform and concise syntax and programming methodology
